# CS569-Nov-2023-Final-Project
The project repository should be "Accepted/Forked" by team leaders only. One team member (team leader) will add their team members as "collaborators" so they could collaborate and push their daily progress.

## Medication Reviews/Side-Effects application:
The application helps users to review and report medication side effects.
1. Users signup and signin before they can use the application.
2. Users may add medications. The medication owner may update or delete their medication.
3. Users browse medications by the first letter [check example](https://www.drugs.com/drug_information.html). Display full alphabet letters, when a letter is clicked all medications starting with the letter are fetched and displayed.
4. Users may submit a new review and read previously submitted reviews. Review owners may update or delete their reviews.
  
### Application specifications and requirements
Your project must use the following:  
* Implement a login-based system with JWT.  
* Browsing and reading reviews is open to guests, but adding, updating, and deleting functionality is restricted to users.
* State properties in all components and services should be declared as signals.
* Use at least one featured lazy-loaded module.
* Projects must have proper UI that complies with the web standards.
   
### Notes
* Students are expected to be available on teams to receive calls and check on their progress.
* A daily push is required to track your code progress and measure your performance. 
* Do not spend more than one hour on a problem, move on, contact me, or find an alternative.
* Remember to update the .gitignore file so you do not push `node_modules` or any private keys from the `.env` file. 

## Need assistance?

Feel free to contact me any day between 8 AM and 8 PM. I’m available to assist all teams with all kinds of requests (system design, backend, frontend, fixing code bugs.. etc). The project is a learning experience and I want everyone to finish the project successfully and meet the course learning outcomes.

## Final Evaluation 

The submission deadline is on Friday at 9:00 PM. I will meet with every team individually on Saturday and Sunday and evaluate the final project code.  

Good luck, and happy coding!
